    "raw": "On a cool winter evening in Beirut, December 27, 2021, an event of unparalleled exclusivity unfolded at the elegantly-appointed Club Mareva Beirut. Nestled within the heart of the city, this renowned cigar lounge, famed for its exquisite selections of the world's finest cigars, hosted an event that had connoisseurs and enthusiasts buzzing with anticipation.\n\nWhat set the stage for the night was not just the allure of enjoying cigars within the cozy confines of the Club Mareva Beirut, but the promise of what was to come - the unreleased Romeo Y Julieta Linea D'Oro Dianas and Romeo Y Julieta Linea D'Oro Hidalgos. Phoenicia Trading, a long-standing partner in Club Mareva's Habanos Lounge status, generously supplied these cigars, further elevating the prestige of the event.\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_3838\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1024\"]<img class=\"wp-image-3838 size-large\" src=\"https://clubmarevabeirut.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/F3AE7C39-63FC-49A9-8D8F-BAAA0A41AF36_1_105_c-1024x576.jpeg\" alt=\"Habanos Lounge Sign at Club Mareva Beirut\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" /> Habanos Lounge Sign at Club Mareva Beirut[/caption]\n\nThe evening unfolded with a limited gathering of twenty individuals. This restriction was not out of necessity but rather a testament to the exclusivity of the event. Each guest was a participant in a rare tasting journey, one which paired the unreleased Romeo Y Julieta Linea D'Oro cigars with Macallan Editions No.2 through No.6.\n\nThe fine cigars, robust in flavour yet subtly nuanced, complemented the richly-textured Macallan whiskies beautifully. As each new edition was uncorked, a symphony of scents filled the air, while the unreleased cigars added an aura of excitement and mystique.\n\nThe Romeo Y Julieta Linea D'Oro Dianas and Hidalgos, known for their exquisite craftsmanship and premium tobacco blends, provided an unforgettable smoking experience. The complexity and rich character of these cigars, in conjunction with the layered and evolving profiles of the Macallan Editions, created an unmatched pairing, the memory of which lingered long after the evening concluded.\n\nAs the evening wound down, the guests, contented and buzzing with conversation, reflected on the unique experience they were a part of. Club Mareva Beirut had once again proved itself as the definitive destination for exclusive events, redefining the boundaries of luxury and sophistication.\n\nIndeed, the year-end event at Club Mareva Beirut was not just a celebration of fine cigars and whisky, but also a testament to the club's commitment to providing unique and unforgettable experiences for its clientele. The year's finale event marked not just the end of a year but also a promise of continued excellence and exclusivity in the days to come.\n\nAnd thus, as the club lights dimmed and the doors closed, one thing was certain - the \"Event of the Year\" had lived up to its name, setting the stage for many more unforgettable experiences to come.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_3840\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"768\"]<img class=\"size-full wp-image-3840\" src=\"https://clubmarevabeirut.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/466717D9-0607-4E60-A68B-FCFB8B927884_1_105_c.jpeg\" alt=\"Romeo Y Julieta Linea D'Oro Hidalgos\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" /> Romeo Y Julieta Linea D'Oro Hidalgos[/caption]\n\n&nbsp;\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_3839\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1024\"]<img class=\"size-full wp-image-3839\" src=\"https://clubmarevabeirut.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/93172B63-703D-4F77-977E-7C54004F03A7_1_105_c.jpeg\" alt=\"Lineup of Romeo Y Julieta Linea Doro and Macallan No.2, 3, 4, 5, 6\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" /> Lineup of Romeo Y Julieta Linea Doro and Macallan No.2, 3, 4, 5, 6[/caption]\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3835\" src=\"https://clubmarevabeirut.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/71D6EB06-F9F3-45E3-9149-D8A84C9B21BB_1_105_c.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" />\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3831\" src=\"https://clubmarevabeirut.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/B9DFB073-C8D9-4A71-B280-36CC8A05E7BF_1_105_c.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" />\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3832\" src=\"https://clubmarevabeirut.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/A1CEA4BB-B936-4321-B2CE-752E2248AA5A_1_105_c.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" />\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_3837\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"665\"]<img class=\"wp-image-3837 size-full\" src=\"https://clubmarevabeirut.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/6BDCC69D-015B-48DE-B6D5-1057385A1F64_1_105_c.jpeg\" alt=\"Woody Ghsoubi presenting Romeo Y Julieta Dianas with a history of the brand\" width=\"665\" height=\"1182\" /> Woody Ghsoubi presenting Romeo Y Julieta Dianas with a history of the brand[/caption]\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3836\" src=\"https://clubmarevabeirut.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/0384E976-1BF7-4A0C-A7C0-AC8D81412452_1_105_c.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" />\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3833\" src=\"https://clubmarevabeirut.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/342AFB33-8F40-4EF7-8283-2A1B6AC7C5B2_1_105_c.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" />\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3830\" src=\"https://clubmarevabeirut.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/9129406C-A0FF-4AEC-B452-F60AB7BB4B95_1_105_c.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" />",
