Battle of the 15 followed the same concept, but with older whiskies, a more confident room, and noticeably sharper instincts.</p>\n<p data-start=\"599\" data-end=\"873\">Five core range single malt whiskies, all aged 15 years and all non peated, were served without revealing their identity. As before, no labels were shown and no hints were given. Guests were asked to rely purely on aroma, palate, finish, and balance when scoring each glass.</p>\n<p data-start=\"875\" data-end=\"1246\">What immediately stood out during this edition was the level of confidence among the attendees. Many had participated in Battle of the 12 and arrived with a clearer framework for tasting. As the night progressed, several guests began quietly naming their guesses before the reveal, discussing cask influence, distillery character, and mouthfeel with surprising precision.</p>\n<p data-start=\"1248\" data-end=\"1624\">When the bottles were finally revealed, many of those guesses turned out to be correct. This reinforced an important idea. Removing labels eliminates bias, but experience still speaks. A trained palate recognizes structure and style even when branding is stripped away. Battle of the 15 showed that instinct, when built on repetition and attention, can be remarkably accurate.</p>\n<p data-start=\"1626\" data-end=\"1722\">The results themselves told a clear story. All bottles were scored out of a possible 800 points.</p>\n<p data-start=\"1724\" data-end=\"2069\">Glenfiddich 15 finished with 399 points, reaching 50 percent.<br data-start=\"1785\" data-end=\"1788\" />Glenlivet 15 followed closely with 417 points, reaching 52 percent.<br data-start=\"1855\" data-end=\"1858\" />Glenfarclas 15 scored 523 points, reaching 65 percent.<br data-start=\"1912\" data-end=\"1915\" />Glen Moray 15 achieved 535 points, reaching 66 percent.<br data-start=\"1970\" data-end=\"1973\" />GlenAllachie 15 stood clearly ahead with 653 points, reaching 81 percent and taking first place.</p>\n<p data-start=\"2071\" data-end=\"2320\">The margin at the top was significant. GlenAllachie 15 emerged as the clear favorite of the evening, while Glen Moray 15 and Glenfarclas 15 formed a strong middle tier. Glenlivet 15 and Glenfiddich 15 placed lower, with similar overall appreciation.</p>\n<p data-start=\"2322\" data-end=\"2629\">Despite the structure of scoring and ranking, the atmosphere remained relaxed and social. Notes were compared, opinions were challenged, and reactions during the reveal ranged from laughter to genuine surprise. The event was not about proving expertise, but about enjoying the process of discovery together.</p>\n<p data-start=\"2631\" data-end=\"2902\">Battle of the 15 confirmed what the first edition had already suggested. When labels are removed, honesty increases. When experience is present, instinct becomes sharper. These tastings are not competitions in the traditional sense. They are conversations with the glass.</p>\n<p data-start=\"2904\" data-end=\"3106\">With two successful editions completed and growing interest around the concept, the next chapter is already planned. Battle of the 18 will explore how further aging reshapes depth, texture, and balance.</p>\n<p data-start=\"3108\" data-end=\"3257\" data-is-last-node=\"\" data-is-only-node=\"\">At Club Mareva Beirut, these events continue to bring people together around curiosity, learning, and the pleasure of tasting without preconceptions.</p>\n\n<h3><b><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4398\" src=\"https://clubmarevabeirut.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Mareva20260108-L0013.jpg\" alt=\"\" /> <img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4400\" src=\"https://clubmarevabeirut.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Mareva20260108-L0015.jpg\" alt=\"\" /> <img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4402\" src=\"https://clubmarevabeirut.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Mareva20260108-L0017.jpg\" alt=\"\" /> <img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4405\" src=\"https://clubmarevabeirut.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Mareva20260108-L0023.jpg\" alt=\"\" /> <img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4407\" src=\"https://clubmarevabeirut.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Mareva20260108-L0030.jpg\" alt=\"\" /> <img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4409\" src=\"https://clubmarevabeirut.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Mareva20260108-L0035.jpg\" alt=\"\" /> <img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4411\" src=\"https://clubmarevabeirut.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Mareva20260108-L0038.jpg\" alt=\"\" /> <img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4413\" src=\"https://clubmarevabeirut.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Mareva20260108-L0046.jpg\" alt=\"\" /> <img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4418\" src=\"https://clubmarevabeirut.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Mareva20260108-L0061.jpg\" alt=\"\" /> <img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4421\" src=\"https://clubmarevabeirut.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Mareva20260108-L0069.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1667\" /> <img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4423\" src=\"https://clubmarevabeirut.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Mareva20260108-L0071.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1667\" /> <img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4424\" src=\"https://clubmarevabeirut.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Mareva20260108-L0075.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1667\" /> <img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4428\" src=\"https://clubmarevabeirut.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Mareva20260108-L0085.jpg\" alt=\"\" /> <img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4430\" src=\"https://clubmarevabeirut.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Mareva20260108-L0091.jpg\" alt=\"\" /> <img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4442\" src=\"https://clubmarevabeirut.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Mareva20260108-L0101.jpg\" alt=\"\" /> <img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4431\" src=\"https://clubmarevabeirut.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Mareva20260108-L0093.jpg\" alt=\"\" /> <img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4433\" src=\"https://clubmarevabeirut.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Mareva20260108-L0099.jpg\" alt=\"\" /> <img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4434\" src=\"https://clubmarevabeirut.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Mareva20260108-L0105.jpg\" alt=\"\" /> <img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4438\" src=\"https://clubmarevabeirut.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Mareva20260108-L0113.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1667\" /></b></h3>\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;",
