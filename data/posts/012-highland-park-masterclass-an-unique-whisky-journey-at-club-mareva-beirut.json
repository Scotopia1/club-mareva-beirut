    "raw": "On Thursday, May 1st, 2025, Club Mareva Beirut had the pleasure of hosting another outstanding whisky experience—the Highland Park Masterclass. The event quickly filled up, underscoring the deep appreciation our community has for distinctive whisky experiences.\n\nGuided by the esteemed Master of Spirits, Elie Abi Khalil, our guests explored the rich heritage and masterful craftsmanship behind Highland Park, one of Scotland’s most iconic single malt distilleries. The carefully curated tasting lineup offered attendees a deep dive into the remarkable flavors and nuanced character that Highland Park whiskies uniquely embody.\n\nGuests enjoyed a diverse range of expressions:\n<ul data-spread=\"false\">\n \t<li>Highland Park Old Fashioned Cocktail</li>\n \t<li>Highland Park 12 Year Old</li>\n \t<li>Highland Park 15 Year Old</li>\n \t<li>Highland Park 18 Year Old</li>\n \t<li>Highland Park 21 Year Old (2020 release)</li>\n \t<li>Highland Park 21 Year Old (2023 release)</li>\n</ul>\nElie enriched the evening with fascinating insights about the distillery's unique location in Orkney. He described how the abundant heather profoundly influences the soil and ultimately shapes the distinctive character of Highland Park whiskies. Particularly interesting was his explanation of the integral role bees play—pollinating the heather, which in turn enhances the richness and floral qualities of the soil. This natural synergy between bees, heather, and soil contributes significantly to the unique aromatic profile and subtly sweet undertones characteristic of Highland Park whiskies.\n\nEach selection was thoughtfully chosen to illustrate the complexity and bold character for which Highland Park is renowned. The evening was complemented by engaging insights from Elie, whose knowledge and passion for whisky enhanced every sip.\n\nAs a special thank-you, each guest was gifted a bottle of Highland Park 12 Year Old, allowing the delightful experience to extend beyond the evening.\n\nWe at Club Mareva Beirut are proud to be the forefront destination for premium whisky tastings, consistently hosting the first tastings of exciting new releases and timeless classics alike.\n\nA heartfelt thank you to everyone who attended and contributed to making this event a resounding success. We look forward to welcoming you back soon for more exceptional whisky adventures.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4235\" src=\"https://clubmarevabeirut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/BB9D805A-EF5E-41C3-8DDD-4C2FAA1C9E00_1_105_c.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" /> <img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-4236\" src=\"https://clubmarevabeirut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/2E39C44E-3F81-482A-B5AA-797A9E01666F_1_105_c.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" /> <img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-4237\" src=\"https://clubmarevabeirut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/BA745162-2EB3-4A00-AC8F-C7EA8863B3DF_1_105_c.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" /> <img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-4238\" src=\"https://clubmarevabeirut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/AF884E45-FA04-47D6-B0FC-76AE886390F1_1_105_c-1.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" />",
