    "raw": "<p class=\"p1\">Thursday, September 25th marked another sold-out whisky tasting at Club Mareva Beirut, and this one stood out as one of the best so far. With every seat taken and a curated lineup that offered range and complexity, the evening delivered on every level.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The tasting was presented by <span class=\"s2\">Kenny Abi Chedid</span>, whose knowledge and easygoing style made for an engaging experience from the first pour to the last. His presentation guided guests through a journey of smoke, sherry, oak, and rum finishes, offering insights into each bottle’s story and profile.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The lineup included:</p>\n\n<ul>\n \t<li>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Meikle Toir 2018 Single Cask</b></span> — One of only eight bottles received in Lebanon, this rare release was a clear highlight of the night. Its bold character and rich smokiness set the tone beautifully.</p>\n</li>\n \t<li>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Meikle Toir Turbo</b></span> — A heavy, powerful peated whisky that showcased GlenAllachie’s ability to handle smoke with finesse.</p>\n</li>\n \t<li>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>GlenAllachie Sinteis 2015</b></span> — Matured in virgin Scottish oak and Oloroso sherry casks, it offered a rich, spicy, and layered profile.</p>\n</li>\n \t<li>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>MacNair’s Exploration Rum</b></span> — With notes of tropical fruit and soft sweetness, it brought the tasting to a smooth and surprising close.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"p1\">In retrospect, the MacNair’s would have made an ideal starting point to highlight its subtleties before moving into the heavier expressions, but the flow of the event still allowed each whisky to shine in its own way.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">This tasting further confirmed the quality and innovation coming out of GlenAllachie. The <span class=\"s2\"><b>Meikle Toir range</b></span> stood out as a perfect example of mainland peat done right — smoky, clean, and full of depth.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">We’re grateful to everyone who joined us and helped make this event such a success. A limited number of these bottles are still available by the glass at the lounge. We encourage you to revisit them while they last.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Stay tuned for what’s next at Club Mareva Beirut.</p>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4320\" src=\"https://clubmarevabeirut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/625DCA72-AEEE-4913-8989-DEAD07B79424_1_105_c.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" /> <img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4321\" src=\"https://clubmarevabeirut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/6C41F04F-4F09-464F-8CB7-850E47C207EF_1_105_c.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\" />",
