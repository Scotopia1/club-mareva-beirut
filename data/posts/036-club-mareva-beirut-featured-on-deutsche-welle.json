The article insightfully notes how hookah has remained popular among a diverse range of people, while cigars have emerged as a status symbol for the affluent class.\n\nOur Club's commitment to offering an impressive array of cigars from Nicaragua, Honduras, the Dominican Republic, and Costa Rica was specially mentioned. Our co-owner, Woody Ghsoubi, provided thoughtful commentary on how cigars, though not inherently luxury products, have become perceived as a symbol of social status in Lebanon. Amid these challenging times, some individuals have been spending significantly on cigars and other luxury items, signifying their unique economic standing.\n\nIt's indeed an honor to be recognized by DW, an international platform of this stature. This feature reflects our steadfast commitment to serving our cigar-loving community, and providing an unparalleled experience to our valued patrons.\n\nTo read the full article, please <a href=\"https://www.dw.com/en/lebanon-in-smoke-cigars-for-the-rich-hookah-for-the-poor/a-66331303\">[click here]</a>.
