The pre-light cold draw reveals barnyard, hay, grass, and green tea. Each draw is like discovering a new star system; every note and nuance, a planet to explore. The thick, creamy smoke unfolds beautifully, creating a narrative that draws the smoker deeper into the mysteries of both tobacco and space.
