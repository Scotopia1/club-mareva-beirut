    "raw": "An extraordinary collaboration between Club Mareva Beirut and Casdagli Cigars, this cigar is not merely a blend but an invitation to embark on an epic journey through the cosmos.\n\nThe Odyssey features a vitola—the Gran Corona, a revered and traditional Cuban size that is rare today. It is meticulously designed to provide at least 2.5 hours of celestial exploration, with dimensions of 47 x 235mm. Crafted with precision at the IGM factory in Costa Rica, the Odyssey boasts an Ecuadorian Habano wrapper, carefully aged for three years. This exquisite wrapper is harvested from the renowned Oliva plantations in the lush Los Ríos area of Ecuador, a region with a rich tobacco legacy dating back to the 1970s.\n\nThe binder and filler—the heart and soul of the cigar—are composed of tobaccos that have been aged for eight years, their origins shrouded in secrecy to maintain the blend's exclusive allure. As you light the Odyssey, prepare to be transported on a sensory voyage that mirrors the awe-inspiring vastness of space.\n\n<strong>Design and Presentation</strong>\nThe box itself is a gateway to the universe, featuring a captivating design of a smoker riding a cigar through the star-studded void. This imagery promises an adventure as boundless as the cosmos, with each puff revealing complex layers of flavor that are creamy, full-bodied, and smooth in strength.\n\n<strong>Honoring Tradition</strong>\nThe Odyssey is a celebration of our founders' shared passion for Cuban cigars—a passion that also resonates deeply with Jeremy Casdagli, the visionary behind Casdagli Cigars. To honor this tradition, aged tobaccos were selected to emulate the refined taste of a well-aged Cuban cigar, delivering a smoking experience that is both profound and transcendent.\n\n<strong>A Cosmic Journey of Flavor</strong>\nEach draw of the Odyssey is like discovering a new star system; every note and nuance, a planet to explore. The flavors evolve beautifully, creating a narrative that unfolds gradually, drawing the smoker deeper into the mysteries of both tobacco and space. The journey is accentuated by the careful construction of the cigar, which ensures a slow, even burn, allowing the aficionado to savor the intricate dance of aromas and tastes.\n\n<strong>Limited Edition</strong>\nThis cigar is more than a smoke; it's a passage through time and space, echoing the voyages of the great explorers of old, now reborn in the modern age of exploration through the art of cigar making. With only 200 boxes of 15 cigars each produced, the Club Mareva Beirut Odyssey is exceedingly rare.\n\nIt invites you to pause, reflect, and voyage through a galaxy of sensory delights, making every smoker an astronaut of flavor on a mission to uncover the boundless complexities of tobacco—an odyssey of taste, tradition, and time.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4119 size-fusion-800\" src=\"https://clubmarevabeirut.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/3-800x1056.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"1056\" />",
