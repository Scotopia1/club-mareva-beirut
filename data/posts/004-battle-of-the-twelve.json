    "raw": "<h3>A full house, a real test, and the lesson every whisky drinker eventually needs</h3>\nBattle of the Twelve filled Club Mareva Beirut to capacity with eighteen guests seated and fully engaged. The tasting was built around five bottles that most people believe they already understand. Macallan 12 Years Old Sherry Oak, Glenlivet 12 Years Old Double Oak, GlenAllachie 12 Years Old, Aberlour 12 Years Old Double Cask, and Glenfarclas 12 Years Old.\n\nThese are familiar names. People walk in with beliefs about each one. They think they know what they like. They think they know what they do not like. They think they can tell them apart instantly. This event proved how unreliable that confidence can be.\n\nThe bottles were presented without any clues. No visible shapes. No labels. No brand identity. Just the glass, the aroma, and the palate. The room quickly understood that tasting without information changes everything. What someone believes they taste is often a story created by the mind, not the liquid.\n\nSeveral guests were shocked to discover that the bottle they usually defend scored lower in their personal list, while a bottle they rarely buy took one of their top spots. This is the psychological reality of tasting without context. Once the comfort of recognition disappears, the brain loses its shortcuts. Your senses have to work without the help of assumptions about price, branding, or reputation.\n\nBlind tasting, even if the title of the night avoids the word, is a confrontation with your own biases. It teaches you that the mind builds expectations before the first sip. It teaches you that memory can mislead. It teaches you that we often drink ideas rather than whisky.\n\nAt the final reveal, the reactions were genuine and sometimes surprised. People laughed at their own notes. People compared scores. People admitted they had been tricked by their own confidence. The winner mattered, but the lesson mattered more. Taste becomes honest only when the identity of the bottle is removed.\n\nThe evening was warm, social, and intellectually engaging. Eighteen guests left with a deeper understanding of whisky and a clearer understanding of themselves. Battle of the Twelve succeeded because it reminded everyone that true tasting begins when the mind is forced to slow down and trust the senses.\n\n&nbsp;\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Rank</th>\n<th>Whisky Name</th>\n<th>Score out of 640</th>\n<th>Percentage</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>GlenAllachie 12</td>\n<td>512</td>\n<td>80 percent</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>Glenlivet 12</td>\n<td>451</td>\n<td>71 percent</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>Aberlour 12</td>\n<td>391</td>\n<td>61 percent</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>Macallan 12</td>\n<td>390</td>\n<td>61 percent</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>Glenfarclas 12</td>\n<td>382</td>\n<td>60 percent</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nClub Mareva Beirut will continue creating events that challenge the palate and open new discussions.
