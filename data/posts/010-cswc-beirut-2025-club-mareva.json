With the presence of <span class=\"s2\"><b>Marko Bilić</b></span>, founder of the global CSWC movement and Mareva International, the atmosphere was electric from the moment the first cigar was lit.</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">The lounge welcomed competitors from across the country for an event that was more than a tournament—it was a celebration of Lebanon’s place in the international cigar scene. Organized and hosted by Club Mareva founders <span class=\"s2\"><b>Woody and Najat</b></span>, the event embodied the refined spirit and deep passion that defines Beirut’s cigar culture.</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">As the competition began, tension built with every slow-burning draw. The margin between triumph and defeat proved to be razor-thin. <span class=\"s2\"><b>Imad Abi Khalil</b></span> claimed victory, despite a 10-minute penalty for momentarily removing the cigar from his hand. In an incredibly close finish, Abi Khalil edged out his closest rival by only <span class=\"s2\"><b>10 seconds</b></span>—a decision so tight, it required a photo review.</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">Runner-up <span class=\"s2\"><b>Mag Demain</b></span> delivered an exceptional performance, demonstrating near-flawless technique and focus. Although he missed the title by mere seconds, his showing will be remembered as one of the strongest in CSWC Beirut history.</p>\n<p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s2\"><b>Paul Abou Atme</b></span> completed the podium in third place, showcasing calm consistency throughout the evening. Meanwhile, <span class=\"s2\"><b>Eddi Abi Abdallah</b></span>, who was on track for a top-three finish, was penalized for ash loss—a small mistake with costly consequences in a discipline where every second and detail matters.</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">The evening was also marked by a standout showing from our female competitors, who brought elegance and impressive timing to the table—further enriching the spirit of inclusivity and excellence that defines the CSWC.</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">One of the night’s most heartfelt moments was the presentation of a special gift by Woody and Najat to Marko Bilić: a <span class=\"s2\"><b>limited-edition collector’s cigar book</b></span>, custom designed for Club Mareva Beirut. Only <span class=\"s2\"><b>150 copies</b></span> of this Beirut Edition exist, making it a true treasure in the world of premium cigars. This gesture honored not only Marko’s leadership in the CSWC world but also the shared memories created between Club Mareva and its international partners, particularly during the unforgettable moments in Cuba.</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">The evening concluded with an exciting announcement: <span class=\"s2\"><b>The CSWC Beirut Championship will return in 2026</b></span>, this time taking place at the iconic <span class=\"s2\"><b>Phoenicia Hotel</b></span>, promising an even grander celebration of Lebanon’s cigar tradition.</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">A special thank you to <span class=\"s2\"><b>ST Dupont</b></span>, our proud sponsor, for adding a touch of luxury and refinement to this unforgettable evening.</p>\n<p class=\"p4\">From all of us at Club Mareva Beirut, thank you to the participants, guests, and CSWC family who made this night one for the books.
