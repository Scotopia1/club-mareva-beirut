    "raw": "<p data-pm-slice=\"1 1 []\">On Thursday, December 5th, Club Mareva Beirut hosted an exceptional whisky tasting event that brought together both long-time members and new attendees who joined us for the first time. The evening was filled with laughter, learning, and, of course, remarkable whiskies, including the oldest bottle we have opened to date at the Club.</p>\nWe had the privilege of tasting an exclusive lineup of <strong>Glenfarclas Family Casks</strong>, including:\n- 🥃 <strong>Glenfarclas Family Cask 1980</strong> (36 years old, bottled Summer 2016)\n- 🥃 <strong>Glenfarclas Family Cask 1999</strong> (22 years old, bottled Summer 2022)\n- 🥃 <strong>Glenfarclas Family Cask 2009</strong> (15 years old, bottled Summer 2024)\n\nOur presenter, Jean Paul Abdallah, expertly guided us through the nuances of each bottle, sharing the rich history and craftsmanship behind Glenfarclas’ legendary single cask releases.\n\nThe evening became even more exciting with our special giveaway. We were thrilled to announce the winners:\n- <strong>Kenny Abi Chedid</strong>, who won the <strong>Glenfarclas 8 Year Old</strong>\n- <strong>Elie Khoury</strong>, who took home the <strong>Glenfarclas 10 Year Old</strong>\n- Several other attendees who received exclusive <strong>Glenfarclas Glencairn glasses</strong> through a fun name-drawing session\n\nIt was wonderful to welcome some new faces to our tastings at the Mareva Malt Mavericks at Club Mareva Beirut. Their enthusiasm and fresh perspectives added to the vibrant energy of the evening, making it even more memorable.\n\nWe extend our heartfelt gratitude to everyone who attended and helped create such a magical atmosphere. These moments remind us why we love coming together to celebrate the finer things in life: great whisky, fine cigars, meaningful connections, and shared experiences.\n\nStay tuned for more extraordinary events at Club Mareva Beirut! These events are invaluable as they allow us to learn more about whisky every time, experience some amazing whiskies that most people would never open, and provide a truly unique opportunity for our attendees.\n<p data-pm-slice=\"1 1 []\"><strong>The three featured bottles can still be served by glass for $100 for the three drams while they last.</strong></p>\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4158\" src=\"https://clubmarevabeirut.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_5474-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"2560\" />",
