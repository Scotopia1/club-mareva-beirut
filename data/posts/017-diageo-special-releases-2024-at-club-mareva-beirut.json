This unforgettable evening brought together 24 whisky enthusiasts who indulged in a curated selection of rare single malts, perfectly paired with fine cigars, cheese, and cold cuts.\n<h3>A Night of Exceptional Whisky</h3>\nGuests had the opportunity to savor some of the finest expressions from Diageo’s Special Releases 2024, including:\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>Benrinnes 21-Year-Old</strong> – A bold and complex dram with rich sherry influences.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Mortlach Special Release</strong> – Known for its intense and full-bodied character, often referred to as \"The Beast of Dufftown.\"</li>\n \t<li><strong>Caol Ila 11-Year-Old</strong> – A smoky Islay malt with maritime and citrus notes.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Oban 10-Year-Old</strong> – A balanced highland whisky with a delicate blend of fruit and spice.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Lagavulin 12-Year-Old</strong> – A peaty masterpiece, delivering deep smoky flavors with a lingering finish.</li>\n</ul>\nEach pour was enjoyed in an intimate setting, allowing guests to explore the distinct characteristics of these exceptional whiskies. The evening’s presentation was led by <strong>Massoud Younes</strong>, who expertly guided attendees through the tasting experience, sharing insights on each expression and its unique profile.\n<h3>The Perfect Pairing Experience</h3>\nAt Club Mareva Beirut, whisky is best appreciated alongside premium cigars, and this event was no exception. Each guest paired their dram of choice with <strong>Adventura The Conqueror</strong>, a cigar known for its rich and bold flavors, enhancing the complexity of both the whisky and the smoke. To further elevate the tasting experience, our signature <strong>cheese and cold cut platters</strong> were served, offering complementary flavors to the carefully selected whiskies.\n<h3>A Full House of Enthusiasts</h3>\nThe event was a resounding success, with a full house of 24 tasters coming together to celebrate their shared passion for fine spirits and cigars. Conversations flowed, notes were compared, and new friendships were forged over drams of some of the finest single malts in the world.\n\nClub Mareva Beirut continues to set the standard for premium whisky and cigar experiences in Lebanon, and we look forward to hosting more exclusive events in the future.
