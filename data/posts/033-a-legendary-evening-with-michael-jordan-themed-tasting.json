An homage to the basketball legend, Michael Jordan, the evening was a fusion of camaraderie, exquisite flavors, and the iconic MJ23 spirit.\n<h4>A Swift Full House</h4>\nThe word spread like wildfire, and the event was fully booked on the very day of its announcement. A testament to the enthusiasm that Michael Jordan's name still ignites across generations.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_3993\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1600\"]<img class=\"size-full wp-image-3993\" src=\"https://clubmarevabeirut.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/973c5942-67d1-4487-9147-a9f27fff9f28.jpeg\" alt=\"Tarek Khayralla and Woody Ghsoubi\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1200\" /> Tarek Khayralla and Woody Ghsoubi with the MJ23 Cigars[/caption]\n<h4>Jerseys Unveiled</h4>\nThe atmosphere buzzed with anticipation as the attendees arrived, not in jerseys, but they were in for a surprise. Club Mareva had a special treat in store – a Michael Jordan jersey for each guest. Donned in their jerseys, the attendees were ready to dive into the spirit of MJ23.\n<h4>Tarek Khayrallah's Insightful Journey</h4>\nThe evening's presenter, Tarek Khayrallah, skillfully steered us through Michael Jordan's journey as a cigar aficionado. Tarek shared captivating anecdotes that shed light on the legend's passion for cigars, offering an intimate glimpse into Michael Jordan's life off the court.\n<h4>Culinary Marvels</h4>\nThe pinnacle of the night came in the form of the MJ23 Double Lancero special cigars, meticulously hand-rolled for the legend himself. The aroma filled the air, and every puff carried a piece of history. Amidst the echoes of the memorable evening, let's not forget the star of the show. This masterpiece, measuring 23.5 cm by 38 ring gauge, boasts a mild to medium strength that invites both novice and seasoned enthusiasts alike to savor its remarkable flavors. From the very first draw to the last lingering note, this cigar unfolds with complexity and creaminess, offering a journey that's as enchanting as it is sophisticated. With each puff, the MJ23 Double Lancero captures the essence of its namesake, creating an experience that's truly worthy of the legend it represents. Accompanied by the Cognac Hennessy VS NBA edition and Cincoro Tequila Anejo, the evening was a symphony of flavors and craftsmanship.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_3995\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"669\"]<img class=\" wp-image-3995\" src=\"https://clubmarevabeirut.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Hennessy_NBA_VS_Box_and_Bottle_Shot__33224.png\" alt=\"Hennessy NBA VS Cognac\" width=\"669\" height=\"669\" /> Hennessy NBA VS Cognac[/caption]\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_3996\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"609\"]<img class=\"wp-image-3996\" src=\"https://clubmarevabeirut.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/image_0b55fb59-7055-4498-b645-a7d86a350de6.png\" alt=\"Cincoro Anejo Tequila\" width=\"609\" height=\"913\" /> Cincoro Anejo Tequila[/caption]\n<h4>A Toast to Greatness</h4>\nEach sip and puff became a tribute to Michael Jordan's indelible legacy. The Cincoro Tequila Anejo, a true embodiment of excellence that stood alongside the MJ23 cigar. Born from the collaboration of five NBA legends, including Michael Jordan himself, Cincoro Tequila is a testament to their shared pursuit of perfection. The Anejo variety, aged to perfection, offers a taste journey that's as smooth as it is rich. With every sip, the harmonious blend of flavors dances on the palate, leaving a lasting impression that mirrors the precision and finesse synonymous with the world of basketball. Just as Michael Jordan brought magic to the court, Cincoro Tequila adds its own touch of enchantment to the evening's experience. The NBA edition of Hennessy VS, a harmonious blend of basketball's spirit and cognac's craftsmanship, joined the celebration, adding an extra layer of richness to the tribute to Michael Jordan's legacy.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3994\" src=\"https://clubmarevabeirut.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/IMG_4043-scaled.jpeg\" alt=\"Club Mareva Beirut and Mareva Malt Mavericks attendees posing for a picture together wearing Michael Jordan jerseys\" width=\"1807\" height=\"1355\" />\n<h4></h4>\n<h4>A Night to Remember</h4>\nBeyond cigars and spirits, the event celebrated the greatness of Michael Jordan. Conversations flowed, connections formed, and shared passion ignited a unique camaraderie. The event reaffirmed that MJ23's influence transcends sports and time, touching lives in unforeseen ways.\n\nWith immense gratitude, we extend our thanks to each attendee who contributed to the event's splendor. Michael Jordan's legacy lives on, a constant reminder that greatness can permeate every aspect of life. Until the next remarkable journey, let's continue embodying the spirit of the Mavericks.\n\nDuring the event, we added an extra touch of generosity by auctioning off two cigars, and we were thrilled with the outcome. Through the collective spirit of giving, we successfully raised an impressive $625. This contribution will directly benefit the Jad Mbarak Foundation's scholarship initiative, allowing us to support education and inspire positive change. We extend our heartfelt gratitude to all who participated in this meaningful endeavor. Your generosity will undoubtedly make a significant impact on deserving individuals through the power of education.\n\nA special thank you goes to Jad Mbarak for making this remarkable event possible.
