This was evident not only in the elegance of the spirits tasted during the evening but also in the recent accolades the distillery received.\n\nJust hours before the event, it was announced that the <strong>Ardnahoe Inaugural Release</strong> had been awarded <strong>GOLD</strong> at both the <em>San Francisco World Spirits Competition 2025</em> and the <em>International Spirits Challenge 2025</em>. The <strong>Ardnahoe Infinite Loch</strong> was also recognized with <strong>SILVER</strong> at both competitions — making the timing of our tasting even more meaningful.\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-4233 size-fusion-1200\" src=\"https://clubmarevabeirut.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/31C6A269-E62A-4F55-BA56-C7FB5D5C07D1-1200x668.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"668\" />\n\nThe lineup for the night featured some incredibly rare expressions — including the Inaugural Release and Society 2024, which are no longer found on shelves anywhere:\n<ul>\n \t<li>🥃 <strong>Ardnahoe Inaugural Release</strong></li>\n \t<li>🥃 <strong>Ardnahoe Infinite Loch</strong></li>\n \t<li>🥃 <strong>Ardnahoe Bholsa</strong></li>\n \t<li>🥃 <strong>Ardnahoe Society 2024</strong></li>\n</ul>\nGuests enjoyed an immersive journey into the world of Ardnahoe, expertly guided by whisky enthusiast Jean Paul Abdallah, whose personal passion and engaging style elevated the entire experience. The tasting was complemented by curated cheese platters and cold cuts, providing a perfect pairing for the bold and nuanced flavors of Islay whisky.\n\nThe atmosphere was warm, enthusiastic, and filled with appreciation for craftsmanship, storytelling, and the unique identity Ardnahoe is building on Islay.\n\nWe thank everyone who attended for being part of this memorable evening, and we extend our congratulations to Ardnahoe Distillery for their well-deserved awards.\n\nThese tasting evenings at Club Mareva have become an inspiring way for our community to grow its understanding and appreciation of whisky. We are truly enjoying the journey — learning, tasting, and sharing discoveries together in a relaxed and welcoming atmosphere.\n\n<strong>As a reminder, Mareva Malt Mavericks — our tasting group at Club Mareva Beirut — is a non-commercial initiative. It's built around genuine passion, curiosity, and the joy of exploration.
