    "raw": "We are thrilled to share with you the unique creation that is the Club Mareva Beirut Cigar, aptly named 'Origin'. This distinctive cigar was born from the combined creativity and hard work of my wife, Najat Abdo, myself, and our esteemed partners, Hendrik Kelner Jr. of the renowned Kelner Boutique Factory (KBF), and Jeremy Casdagli from Casdagli Cigars.\n\nThe honor of crafting a cigar specifically for Club Mareva Beirut was one we relished. The experience of working together was as rich and satisfying as the flavor of the Origin itself.\n\nExcitingly, we have recently received recognition from the prestigious @LuxuryCigarClub - . They've selected the Club Mareva Beirut Origin, our labor of love, for inclusion in their latest ultra-premium sampler - the whimsically named 'OMG WTF' collection. To be included in such an elite selection is truly a nod to the quality and craftsmanship we've aimed to deliver.\n\nWe can't help but be overjoyed at this recognition. It is not only a personal achievement for Najat and myself but a testament to the incredible teamwork and shared vision that has fueled this journey. We are delighted that the Club Mareva Beirut Origin has found its place among such extraordinary company in the @LuxuryCigarClub's sampler. A tremendous honor indeed!
