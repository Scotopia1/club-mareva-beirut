    "raw": "A cigar tasting of Davidoff Escurio Gran Toro took place on Thursday, March 23 at Club Mareva Beirut. Bora Buladi, Vice President of Central Europe, Russia, CIS, Turkey, India and General Director of Davidoff of Geneva Russia LLC, was present at the event.\n\nWe sampled the Escurio Gran Toro, which is part of the Davidoff Discovery line, and paired it with Aberfeldy 12 and 16. The private event was sponsored by Fattal and represented by Raffi Bakhtiarian and George Bou Rjeily.\n\nOnly members of Club Mareva Beirut were invited, and 24 people attended the event. During the event, we had an interesting session where gifts were given out. We asked questions, and the people who answered correctly won valuable gifts.\n\nThe atmosphere was great, and people enjoyed mingling, asking questions, and learning a lot about Davidoff. The event was a fun and educational experience for everyone who attended.\n\nThe Davidoff Escurio Gran Toro is a premium cigar that is carefully crafted and perfectly balanced. It features notes of wood, leather, and spice, which complemented the flavors of the Aberfeldy 12 and 16.\n\nBora Buladi was happy to be present at the event and shared his knowledge about cigars and the Davidoff brand. He talked about the history of Davidoff and the importance of quality in their products.\n\nOverall, the cigar tasting event was a success, and we look forward to more events like this in the future. We thank Fattal, Raffi Bakhtiarian, and George Bou Rjeily for sponsoring the event and making it possible.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3761\" src=\"https://clubmarevabeirut.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/IMAGE-2023-03-25-031954.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"960\" /> <img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3762\" src=\"https://clubmarevabeirut.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/IMAGE-2023-03-25-031959.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"959\" height=\"1280\" /> <img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3763\" src=\"https://clubmarevabeirut.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/IMAGE-2023-03-25-031932.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"960\" height=\"1280\" /> <img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3764\" src=\"https://clubmarevabeirut.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/IMAGE-2023-03-25-031928.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"960\" height=\"1280\" /> <img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3765\" src=\"https://clubmarevabeirut.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/IMAGE-2023-03-25-031939.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"960\" height=\"1280\" />\n\n&nbsp;",
