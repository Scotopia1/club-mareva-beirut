    "raw": "Last Thursday, the atmosphere at Club Mareva Beirut was buzzing with excitement as we hosted another unforgettable whisky tasting event. Our Mareva Malt Mavericks group gathered for an evening filled with laughter, camaraderie, and, of course, exceptional whiskies. The event was a resounding success, with a full house and a fantastic turnout, making it a memorable night for all.\n<h3>Getting to Know SMWS</h3>\nFor those new to the world of whisky, let's start with a brief introduction to SMWS. SMWS stands for the Scotch Malt Whisky Society, an organization renowned for its dedication to discovering and sharing unique single malt whiskies. They carefully select and bottle extraordinary casks from various distilleries, offering whisky enthusiasts the opportunity to savor one-of-a-kind flavors that can't be found elsewhere.\n<h2>The Three SMWS Stars of the Evening</h2>\n<h3>SMWS Devilishly Opulent</h3>\nOur journey into the world of SMWS began with the intriguingly named \"Devilishly Opulent.\" This whisky lived up to its name with rich and complex flavors. It revealed inviting notes of manuka honey, weathered leather, and decadent chocolate on the nose. As we delved deeper, roasted hazelnuts emerged, leading to nuances of dried sultanas and the zest of burnt orange peel. On the palate, it delivered an intense peat experience, accompanied by flavors of mocha and heather honey, all underscored by a background of smoked spices. The finish left us with the comforting warmth of roasted chestnuts and a gentle trace of charred oak. Truly, a devilishly opulent experience.\n<h3>SMWS Slipper Sipper</h3>\nNext up was \"Slipper Sipper,\" a name that hinted at the whisky's elegance and finesse. This bottle filled the senses with the rich aroma of cedarwood and the evocative presence of a cigar box. Subsequent notes of butterscotch, mocha, and zesty orange peel emerged, with a delicate touch of honey and plum jam to round off the aromatic experience. On the palate, it introduced us to dark chocolate, smoked honey, and mocha flavors, accompanied by hints of fig and beet syrup. The finish bid adieu with lingering notes of burnt sugar and the persistent embrace of peat smoke. A slipper sipper, indeed.\n<h3>SMWS I Like Big Butts</h3>\nOur whisky adventure concluded with \"I Like Big Butts,\" a whisky that grabbed our attention with its playful name and kept it with its bold flavors. On the nose, it graced us with delightful aromas of baking spices and caramelized honey, intertwined with the alluring scents of roasted coffee beans and toasted hazelnuts. Subtle undertones of smoked almonds and butterscotch completed the bouquet. On the palate, it offered sweetness, featuring pronounced notes of peat and intense chocolate, complemented by the gentle embrace of heather honey and a touch of cinnamon, further enhanced by the zest of ginger. The finish was a journey of oak smoke and a faint hint of smoked sugar. A whisky that certainly lived up to its reputation.\n<h2>A Memorable Evening</h2>\nThe event was a resounding success, thanks to the incredible whiskies from SMWS and the fantastic turnout of our Mareva Malt Mavericks group. We'd like to extend our gratitude to all who attended and made the evening unforgettable. Stay tuned for more exciting whisky adventures and events at Club Mareva Beirut!\n\nUntil next time, cheers to the world of whisky exploration and discovery!\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_4056\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1536\"]<img class=\"size-full wp-image-4056\" src=\"https://clubmarevabeirut.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/1EC7D9A9-3BF3-40D0-B73F-9B30C91FC42D_1_102_o.jpeg\" alt=\"SMWS Devilishly Opulent, I Like Big Butts, Slipper Sipper\" width=\"1536\" height=\"2048\" /> SMWS Devilishly Opulent, I Like Big Butts, Slipper Sipper[/caption]\n\n&nbsp;\n\n[caption id=\"attachment_4057\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1536\"]<img class=\"size-full wp-image-4057\" src=\"https://clubmarevabeirut.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/4D0893A9-40A8-4254-BB56-FE55E16F033C_1_102_o.jpeg\" alt=\"Kenny Abi Chedid showing us what he likes most\" width=\"1536\" height=\"2048\" /> Kenny Abi Chedid showing us what he likes most[/caption]\n\n<img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-4058\" src=\"https://clubmarevabeirut.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/588C4A22-1F60-4764-96B3-3BB648406BB3_1_102_o.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1536\" height=\"2048\" />",
