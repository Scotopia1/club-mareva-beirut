In an exceptional collaboration with celebrated author <span class=\"s2\"><b>Aaron Sigmond</b></span>, Club Mareva Beirut has been chosen to represent Lebanon in his newest book, <i>Cigars: A Biography, </i> a sweeping and luxurious tribute to cigar culture worldwide.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">In this <span class=\"s2\"><b>special edition created exclusively for Lebanon and the Middle East</b></span>, our very own <span class=\"s2\"><b>Club Mareva Odyssey cigar</b></span> graces the cover, a gesture that symbolizes the respect, admiration, and authenticity that Sigmond found in our lounge and community.</p>\n\n<h3><b>Lebanon’s Sole Representative</b></h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s2\"><b>Club Mareva Beirut is the only cigar lounge in Lebanon to be featured in the book</b></span>, marking a powerful acknowledgment of our role in shaping and elevating cigar culture in the region. To be chosen by a figure as respected as Aaron Sigmond — a man whose knowledge and love for cigars span decades  is both humbling and deeply rewarding.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">This edition is not just a mention. It is a spotlight. A declaration that Beirut has a seat at the global table of fine cigar tradition.</p>\n\n<h3><b>A Collector’s Treasure</b></h3>\n<p data-pm-slice=\"1 1 []\">Limited to only <strong>150 hand numbered copies</strong>, this special edition is a <strong>true collector’s treasure</strong>. It is sure to become one of the most talked-about pieces in the libraries of cigar lovers and collectors around the world. Each copy is available only at Club Mareva Beirut for <strong>$200</strong>, and once sold, no more will ever be made. With its striking cover featuring the Club Mareva Odyssey cigar and its status as the only Lebanon and Middle East edition, this book is more than just a book. It is a symbol of refined taste, a rare collectible, and a bridge to the timeless beauty of cigar culture. Created for those who appreciate rare finds, meaningful stories, and beautiful design, this edition is a one-of-a-kind chance to own a piece of cigar history.</p>\n\n<h3><b>A Book Decades in the Making</b></h3>\n<p data-pm-slice=\"1 1 []\"><em>Cigars: A Biography</em> is the result of <strong>years of meticulous research, storytelling, and artistic devotion</strong>. Aaron Sigmond, whose legacy spans luxury publishing and cigar connoisseurship, has poured decades of insight, experience, and personal exploration into this singular volume. His writing is not merely informative; it is immersive. Readers are guided through the origins of cigars, their evolution over centuries, and their enduring place as objects of ritual, reverence, and reflection. Unlike many cigar books that focus solely on Cuba, this work presents a panoramic view of the cigar world, honoring all major cigar-producing countries including the Dominican Republic, Nicaragua, Honduras, Mexico, the United States, and more.</p>\nBut the soul of this book is not found only in its words; it is illuminated by the extraordinary visual work of <strong>Ian Spanier</strong>, an award-winning photographer whose lens captures cigars with a richness and depth rarely seen. Each image is deliberate and soulful, transforming printed pages into an experience of texture, emotion, and atmosphere. Spanier, a passionate cigar enthusiast himself, brings intimacy and reverence to every frame, the way only a true aficionado could.\n\nThe collaboration between Sigmond and Spanier has resulted in a rare alchemy: a book that transcends genres, formats, and trends. <em>Cigars: A Biography</em> is not just a biography of an object; it is a celebration of a lifestyle, an homage to artisans and aficionados, and a timeless artifact for collectors.\n\nTogether, they have created more than a book. They have created a <strong>monument to the cigar</strong>, a masterwork that captures its enduring legacy as both a personal indulgence and a cultural emblem.\n<h3><b>A Celebration of Culture and Craft</b></h3>\n<p data-pm-slice=\"1 1 []\">This collaboration is more than a feature; it is a celebration. A shared vision between global icons of cigar literature and Lebanon’s most dedicated cigar lounge. It is also a tribute to the growing presence and voice of the Middle East in the world of luxury cigars.</p>\nFounded by Woody and Najat Abdo, Club Mareva Beirut has always strived to honor tradition while embracing innovation. Being featured in this book marks another proud milestone in our journey to elevate Lebanon's place on the global cigar map.\n\nWe invite you to own a piece of this legacy, a book that you will not only read, but truly cherish.\n\nNow available <strong>only at Club Mareva Beirut</strong>.
